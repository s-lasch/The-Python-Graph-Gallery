          <h2>Our Use of Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and
            numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored
            by the browser. <br />
            The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser
            requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either "persistent"
            cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by
            a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date,
            unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie,
            on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when
            the web browser is closed. <br />
            Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally
            identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you
            may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from
